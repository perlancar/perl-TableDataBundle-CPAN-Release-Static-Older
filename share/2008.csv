http://biodas.org/ for the serving of biological data using XML over

Bio::Das::ProServer is designed as a lightweight alternative to some
other DAS servers. Version 2.0 is a drop-in replacement for previous
versions but has a core based on the POE system which is much better
tested and debugged than the ProServer v1 core. ProServer can be seen
as the server-side complement to the Bio-DasLite client.
